# Ivee Free Tier

## Experience Ivee at No Cost

The Ivee Free Tier lets you explore and experiment with our DBaaS platform without any financial commitment. 
It's a great way to get hands-on experience and see how Ivee can benefit your projects.

## Important Notes

* **Subject to Change:** The specifics of the Free Tier, including limitations and available resources, may change as we evolve the platform.

## Current Limitations

* **Public DBaaS:** 
    * Deploy up to 1 database per supported technology (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Valkey, FerretDB).
* **Bring Your Own Account (BYOA):**
    * Deploy up to 5 databases per supported technology.
* **High Availability:** High availability configurations are not available in the Free Tier.
* **Instance Resources:**
    * 1 CPU core
    * 2 GB RAM
    * 16 GB storage
* **Serverless Pause:** Instances will automatically pause if there are no active connections or activity for a period of time.
This helps conserve resources and keep your usage within the Free Tier limits.
