# Autoscaling

Ivee's autoscaling feature allows your databases to dynamically adapt to changing workloads, 
ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.

## Horizontal Scaling

Ivee scales your databases horizontally by adding or removing replicas based on real-time demand. 
This ensures that your database can handle peak loads without performance degradation.

### Intelligent Scaling Decisions

Our autoscaling system monitors various metrics, including:

* CPU and Memory utilization
* Network traffic
* Database specific metrics (like number of connections or queries per second).

By analyzing these metrics, Ivee intelligently determines when to scale your database up or down, 
providing a seamless and responsive experience for your applications.

### Control and Flexibility

You have full control over autoscaling. You can enable or disable it at any time, 
allowing you to fine-tune the scaling behavior to match your specific needs and preferences.

In a Free Tier autoscaling is disabled.

## Scale Down to Zero

Ivee takes autoscaling a step further with the "Scale Down to Zero" feature. This allows your databases 
to be automatically paused when there is no activity or connections.

### Cost Savings and Environmental Impact

Scaling down to zero significantly reduces your cloud bill by eliminating costs associated with idle resources. 
It also contributes to a lower carbon footprint by minimizing energy consumption.

### Automatic Reactivation

When a user or application attempts to connect to a paused database, 
Ivee automatically detects the connection and instantly reactivates the instance. 
This ensures a seamless experience for your users without any manual intervention.

### Benefits of Scale Down to Zero:

* **Reduced cloud costs:** Pay only for the resources you use.
* **Lower carbon footprint:** Minimize energy consumption and environmental impact.
* **Simplified database management:**  No need to manually start and stop instances.
* **Improved resource utilization:** Free up resources for other critical applications.

With Ivee's autoscaling and "Scale Down to Zero" features, you can enjoy a dynamic and cost-effective database 
solution that adapts to your needs while minimizing your environmental impact.
