# Ivee for FerretDB

## MongoDB-compatible, Open Source Goodness

FerretDB is an open source proxy that translates MongoDB wire protocol queries to SQL, 
allowing you to use MongoDB drivers and tools with PostgreSQL as the underlying database. 
This provides the familiarity of MongoDB with the benefits of PostgreSQL's robustness and rich feature set.
