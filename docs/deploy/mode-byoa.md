# Bring your own account (BYOA)

## Full control, enhanced flexibility

Ivee's Bring Your Own Account (BYOA) mode allows you to host your databases directly within your own cloud accounts (AWS or GCP). This gives you:

* **Data ownership:** Maintain complete control and ownership of your data.
* **Cost optimization:** Leverage existing cloud provider agreements and discounts (e.g., Reserved Instances).
* **Compliance:** Meet specific regulatory or internal data residency requirements.

## Get started with BYOA

1. **Add your account:**
    * In the Ivee portal, navigate to "Account Configs".
    * Follow the prompts to securely add your AWS or GCP account credentials.

2. **Create a database:**
    * When creating a new database, select the "BYOA" deployment mode.
    * Choose the cloud provider and account you've added.

## Benefits of BYOA

* **Managed experience:** Enjoy the same Ivee management features and ease of use, even within your own cloud environment.
* **Seamless integration:** Leverage Ivee's capabilities while retaining your existing cloud infrastructure and workflows.
* **Enhanced security:** Benefit from additional security layers by keeping your data within your own cloud account.

## Important notes

* **Supported providers:** Currently, BYOA is supported for AWS and GCP. Azure support is coming soon.
* **Free Tier limitations:** The Free Tier allows for up to 5 databases per technology in BYOA mode.
* **Account security:** Ensure your cloud account credentials are securely managed and adhere to best practices.

**BYOA gives you the best of both worlds: full control over your data and the convenience of Ivee's managed database service.**
